Average = (sum of observation/no of observation) 
Ex::10,20,30,40,50/5=30
::If difference is in a sequence(consecutive manner) then add 1 st and  last no( or) middle term
:: same quantity like all in kgs( or) cm
etc . 
Consecutive natural numbers::
----------------------------------------------------
X, x+1, x+2,x+3,x+4-----(1, 2,3,4,5) 
Consecutive even numbers::
---------------------------------------------------
X, x+2, x+4, x+6-----(2, 4,6,8) 
Consecutive odd numbers::
---------------------------------------------------
X, x+2, x+4, x+6---(1, 3,5,7,9) 
Important formulas::
--------------------------------
Sum of first 'n' natural nos:: n* (n+1) /2
Average of first n' natural nos::(n+1) /2
Sum of the squares of first n' natural nos::((n+1) (2n+1)) /6
Sum of the cubes of first n' natural nos::(n2(n+1)2)/4
Average of first "n" Consecutive odd no=n
Average of first "n" Consecutive even no=n+1)                                 Even         en            Odd

probelms:
----------
 find averge of first 18 natural numbers?

sol:
(n+1)/2=(18+1)/2=19/2=9.5  (OR) 1,,2,3,----18  1+18/2=9.5

 find averge of first 20 multiples of 3 numbers?
sol:
3,6,9,12,---60=(3+60)/2=63/2=31.5


calculare the average of the sqares of natural number from 1 to 10
1^2,,2^2,,3^2,----10^2
(n+1)(2n+1)/6=(10+1)(2*10+1)/6=38.5


calculare the average of the cubes of natural number from 1 to 10
1^3,,2^3,,3^3,----10^3
(n*(n+1)^2)/4=(10*(10+1))/4=27.5


***if the avergea of first "n" consecutive odd no(1,3) is 60.then find the sum of rhe numbers.
sol:
avg=sum of no/no of obs
s.o=avg*no
s.o=60*n=60*60=3600
1,3=1+3/2=2
1,3,5=5
1,3,5,7,=4
1,3,5,7,,9=5

average of 31 students is 11.5 years.if teacher is age is included averge age is increased by 1. What is the teachers age?
sol:
  aver=sum of obs/no of obser
  here given is sum(31)=11.5(avg)*31(no of stud)=356.5
   and increasedd is sum(32)=12.5(avg)*32=400
    400-356.5=44.5 is the answer

--------------------------------

1.the avg age if 39 students and a teacher of acladd are is 11 years.If the age of teacher is excluded the avg age of the class is reduced by 1.What is the age off teacher?
sol:
  sum

2.the aveerge age of the  4 brothers is 12 years. if the age of their mother ris also includeed, the averge eis increased by 5 years. the age of the mother in years is?
sol:
  sum(4)=4*12=48
  sum(5)=5*17((12+5))=85
    85-48=37

3.5 years ago , the averrage of A,B,C and D was 45 years. With E join them now, the average of all the all five is 49 years. How old is E?
sol:
  
       (+1 4-50,5-49)-1
     4*50=200    245-200=45
     5*49=245
4.3 years ago , the averrage of 5 members was 17 years. With a baby join them now, the average  age of family member is the samre today?
the present age of the baby is?
sol:
  (+1 5-20,6-17)-3
  17-15=2 years
  5*20=100    102-100=2 years
  66*17=102
5.the average age of 400 students of a class is 15 years.When  10 new student are admited, the average is incereased by 0.2 years. the average age of the new students is?
sol:
  40-15
  (+10 50-15.2)0.2
